Sample PHP Texas Hold 'em
==============================================

Prompt
--------

Create an algorithm that ranks a set of poker hands using TEXAS HOLD-EM rules (5 community cards, 2 private cards - where the best 5 of the 7 cards are used to rank the player's hand) for 2-6 players, and then ranks those hands from best to worst according to traditional poker hand ranking rules.
Note: You do not need to code any support beyond the ranking of the hands after being dealt, such as any betting functionality.

Notes
--------

* Namespace is THE (Texas Hold 'Em) even though the code can easily be changed to any game.
